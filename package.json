  "description": "This is a static Middleman-based website Iâ€™m using as my personal site at [gesteves.com](http://gesteves.com). An import script pulls data from several social networks and services I use and puts it in the `data/` and `source/images` folders to populate the site. A cron job running on Heroku periodically re-generates the site using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) to keep it up to date, and syncs it to an Amazon S3 bucket, where it gets served from Amazon CloudFront for extra speediness.",
